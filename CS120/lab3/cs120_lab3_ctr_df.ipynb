By leveraging this sparsity and using sparse vector representations for OHE data, we can reduce storage and computational burdens. Below are a few sample vectors represented as dense numpy arrays. Use [SparseVector](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html#pyspark.mllib.linalg.SparseVector) to represent them in a sparse fashion, and verify that both the sparse and dense representations yield the same results when computing dot products (we will later use MLlib to train classifiers via gradient descent, and MLlib will need to compute dot products between SparseVectors and dense parameter vectors).\n",

On the other hand, SparseVector(3, [2, 1], [5, 5]) will give you an error because the indices list [2, 1] is not in ascending order. Note: you cannot simply sort the indices list, because otherwise the values will not correspond to the respective indices anymore.\n",
