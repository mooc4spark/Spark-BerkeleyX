    "# Principal Component Analysis Lab\n",
    "This lab delves into exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. We will use a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy). Specifically, we'll work with time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern. Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and we can use exploratory analyses to identify these patterns. Read [\"Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing\"](http://thefreemanlab.com/work/papers/freeman-2014-nature-methods.pdf) for more information about these kinds of analyses.\n",

    "Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a strategy for dimensionality reduction. To better understand PCA, we'll work with synthetic data generated by sampling from the [two-dimensional Gaussian distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution). This distribution takes as input the mean and variance of each dimension, as well as the covariance between the two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our visualizations below, we will specify the mean of each dimension to be 50 and the variance along each dimension to be 1. We will explore two different values for the covariance: 0 and 0.9. When the covariance is zero, the two dimensions are uncorrelated, and hence the data looks spherical. In contrast, when the covariance is 0.9, the two dimensions are strongly (positively) correlated and thus the data is non-spherical. As we'll see in Parts 1 and 2, the non-spherical data is amenable to dimensionality reduction via PCA, while the spherical data is not."

In particular, the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is the direction of maximal variance (this is sometimes called the \"top\" eigenvector). Eigendecomposition of a \\scriptsize $d \\times d$ covariance matrix has a (roughly) cubic runtime complexity with respect to $d$. Whenever $d$ is relatively small (e.g., less than a few thousand) we can quickly perform this eigendecomposition locally.\n",

If our initial data is \\scriptsize dd-dimensional, then the total variance in our data equals:$\\sum_{i=1}^d \\lambda_i$, where $\\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the $i$th principal component.

    "A central challenge in neuroscience is understanding the organization and function of neurons, the cells responsible for processing and representing information in the brain. New technologies make it possible to monitor the responses of large populations of neurons in awake animals. In general, neurons communicate through electrical impulses that must be recorded with electrodes, which is a challenging process. As an alternative, we can genetically engineer animals so that their neurons express special proteins that fluoresce or light up when active, and then use microscopy to record neural activity as images.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recently developed method called light-sheet microscopy lets us do this in a special, transparent animal, the larval zebrafish, over nearly its entire brain. The resulting data are time-varying images containing the activity of hundreds of thousands of neurons. Given the raw data, which is enormous, we want to find compact spatial and temporal patterns: Which groups of neurons are active together? What is the time course of their activity? Are those patterns specific to particular events happening during the experiment (e.g. a stimulus that we might present). PCA is a powerful technique for finding spatial and temporal patterns in these kinds of data, and that's what we'll explore here!"

This provides us with a visual representation which we can use to see the overall structure of the zebrafish brain and to identify where high and low values occur. However, using this representation, there is a substantial amount of useful information that is difficult to interpret. In the next visualization, we'll see how we can improve interpretability by combining the two principal components into a single image using a color mapping."

However, when performing PCA on the full dataset, there are multiple reasons why neurons might have similar responses. The neurons might respond similarly to different stimulus directions, their responses might have similar temporal dynamics, or their response similarity could be influenced by both temporal and stimulus-specific factors. However, with our initial PCA analysis, we cannot pin down the underlying factors, and hence it is hard to interpret what \"similarity\" really means."

We then use the well-known polar color space, [hue-saturation-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) (HSV), and map the angle to hue and the magnitude to value (brightness). This maps low magnitude points to black while allowing larger magnitude points to be differentiated by their angle. Additionally, the function `polarTransform` that maps low-dimensional representations to colors has an input parameter called scale, which we set to 2.0, and you can try lower values for the two graphs to see more nuanced mappings -- values near 1.0 are particularly interesting."

    "n the analysis in Part 3, we performed PCA on the full time series data, trying to find global patterns across all 240 seconds of the time series. However, our analysis doesn't use the fact that different events happened during those 240 seconds. Specifically, during those 240 seconds, the zebrafish was presented with 12 different direction-specific visual patterns, with each one lasting for 20 seconds, for a total of 12 x 20 = 240 features. Stronger patterns are likely to emerge if we incorporate knowledge of our experimental setup into our analysis. As we'll see, we can isolate the impact of temporal response or direction-specific impact by appropriately aggregating our features.\n",

First, note that if we use `np.dot` with a two-dimensional array, then NumPy performs the equivalent matrix-multiply calculation.

We can generate this result via matrix multiplication as follows: `np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 3, 0]]).dot(np.array([1, 2, 3])` which produces `np.array([4, 6])`.\n",

We'll cache and count the output, as we'll be using it again."

Use the `pca` function from Part (2a) to perform PCA on the this data with $k=3$, resulting in a new low-dimensional 46460 by 3 dataset. As before, you'll need to extract the values from `direction_data` since it is an RDD of key-value pairs."

    "Again, let's view the scores from the first two principal components as a composite image. When we preprocess by averaging across time (group by direction), and then perform PCA, we are only looking at variability related to stimulus direction. As a result, if neurons appear similar -- have similar colors -- in the image, it means that their responses vary similarly across directions, regardless of how they evolve over time. In the image below, we see a different pattern of similarity across regions of the brain. Moreover, regions on either side of the midline are colored differently, which suggests that we are looking at a property, direction selectivity, that has a different representation across the two sides of the brain."
